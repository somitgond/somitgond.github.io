<h2 id="xsetroot-problem">Xsetroot Problem:</h2>
<p>Description: I encountered a problem when setting background with
xsetroot. I don’t use feh, nitrogen, xwallpaper or any other background
setter application. I wanted to find a minimal program that can be used
to set my background as a solid color. I ran the code
<code>xsetroot -solid black</code>. But the background doesn’t change.
The background remains gray in color.</p>
<p>Background: For your information I am currently on Debian 12 using
dwm, st, slstatus, xcompmgr etc. I am trying to find minimal programs
i.e programs that use less RAM and CPU. I have used feh, nitrogen,
xwallpaper as wallpaper setting application. I don’t have any specific
requirements regarding desktop background, it can be anything other than
solid black.</p>
<p>What is xsetroot: You can read its manual page <a
href="https://www.x.org/archive/X11R7.5/doc/man/man1/xsetroot.1.html">here</a>
or just from searching on the internet. So, xsetroot is root window
parameter setting utility for X as stated in the manual. One of its main
feature is that you can set the background of the root window.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution:</h2>
<p>The quest to find the solution to the problem: 1. As usual I started
with scrouing the internet for the solution I found some leads, that i
am not the only one suffering from the problem. 2. Basically what I came
to know is that some other application is setting the root window
background after xsetroot. 3. Now how to find that application. - I
checked any sytemd service which can be causing the issue. After
enabling and disabling a bunch of services. I didn’t find anything. The
problem still persisted. - Then I check if any autostart application was
causing the issue. - Then finally I turned off my compositor manager.
Guess what? It was causing the issue. So, We finally found the solution
to our problem. The compositor was redrawing on the root window.</p>
<p>Afterwards I did additional search on the internet and I found many
people has already discovered it :), Guess I need to sharpen my OSINT
skills :(</p>
<p>PS: For those who don’t know about compositor read about it <a
