# This Blog describes my current desktop setup

### Hardware:

- Thinkpad T480 with i5-350U processor, 8GB DDR4 RAM   

### Software

I am currently using !(Void Linux)["https://voidlinux.org/"] as an operating system. Why? you might ask. Mainly because its minimal and fast. I will likely switch over to BSD operating system soon.    
For the desktop part, I use a bunch of suckless programs mainly dwm for window management, st for terminal, dmenu for application finder, slock for locking the screen, slstatus to show status on dwm bar.  
Other notable applications include Firefox for browing the web, Neovim for all editing tasks.   

My dotfiles and configurations for dwm, st, slstatus are on the github.
