<li>Thinkpad T480 with i5-350U processor, 8GB DDR4 RAM</li>

<p>I am currently using <a href="https://voidlinux.org/">Void Linux</a>
as an operating system. Why? you might ask. Mainly because its minimal
and fast. I will likely switch over to BSD operating system soon.<br />
For the desktop part, I use a bunch of suckless programs mainly dwm for
window management, st for terminal, dmenu for application finder, slock
for locking the screen, slstatus to show status on dwm bar.<br />
Other notable applications include Firefox for browing the web, Neovim
for all editing tasks.</p>
<p>My dotfiles and configurations for dwm, st, slstatus are on the
github.</p>
